# Purpose: to open an image and be able to click on points of the image
# to create the code for a Polygon.
# Click on the "Stop" box to the top left side of the window to stop creating points
# and print the Polygon code.

# Added Stop box to end clicking

# Thanks to Robert Hildenbrand and Lyssa Scott for causing me to
# create this program
